Used cell type: 
hTERT RPE-1 are hTERT-immortalized retinal pigment epithelial cells.
Microscope: Confocal Microscope Zeiss LSM 980 AIRY Fast (40 X objective, 1.2NA) 
Protocol (Materials and Method)
Day 0 

- Sample preparation: culture cells according to standard conditions and seed them on 12 mm round coverslips

Day 1

- Fixation: 5 min in cold Methanol
Transfer the coverslip to a new 12-well plate. Wash with PBS 1x and add 1 ml of cold methanol to each 12 well. Incubate 5 min at -20. Then wash with PBS 1x.

- Protein crosslinking prevention: incubate coverslips in the AA/FA solution for 3h30min at 37˚C.
 
- Gelation: incubate coverslips with the monomer solution, supplemented with 0.5% TEMED and 0.5% APS, for 1h at 37˚C in a wet and dark chamber.

- Denaturation: incubate 15-30 minutes in denaturation buffer at RT on a shaker + 1h30min for centrioles at 95˚C (using the Thermomixer at 400 RPM) in fresh denaturation buffer.

- First round of expansion: place the gel in distilled water at RT. Exchange water 2 times every 30 minutes.

- Gel measurement: with a caliper.

- Gel shrinkage: place the gel in PBS, 2 times 15 minutes each, to remove water excess before Ab incubation.

- Blocking: 30min at 37˚C in a shaker (warm room, over the 2L flask shaker, at 50 RPM).
Blocking solution: BSA 3%, Triton-X 100 0.05% in PBS.

- Blocking wash: wash gels in PBS+Tween20 0.1%, 1 time 10 minutes in a shaker at RT.
 
- Primary Ab incubation: ON at 4˚C in a shaker (cold room).
BSA 1%, Tween 0.05% in PBS

NHS (647), Acetylated Tubulin (594), αβ-tubulin (488), DAPI (405)



Day 2

- Primary Ab wash: after primary Ab incubation, wash gels in PBS+Tween20 0.1%, 3 times 10 minutes in a shaker at RT.

- Secondary Ab incubation: 2.30/3h at 37˚C in a shaker (warm room, over the 2L flask shaker, at 50 RPM) protected from light.
I am using 1:1000 concentration.
 
- Secondary Ab wash: after primary Ab incubation, wash gels in PBS+Tween20 0.1%, 3 times 10 minutes in a shaker at RT.

- Pan labelling: first, wash gels in NaHCO3 100 mM pH 8.3 in a shaker at RT. Then, incubate gels in Pan labelling solution for 1:30h in a shaker at RT protected from light.
 
- Pan labelling wash: after Pan labelling incubation, wash gels in PBS+Tween20 0.1%, 3 times 10 minutes in a shaker at RT protected from light.


- Hoechst staining: incubate gels in Hoechst solution 10 minutes in a shaker at RT protected from light.
Hoechst solution: 1 μg/ml in PBS.

- Hoechst wash: wash gels in PBS+Tween20 0.1%, 1 time 10 minutes in a shaker at RT protected from light.

- Second round of expansion: place the gel in distilled water at RT. Exchange water 2 times every 30 minutes.
