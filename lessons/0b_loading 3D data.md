# Loading 3D microscopy data

Blender's volumetric rendering is primarily used for fog and fire animations, we can use the same framework for 3D microscopy data. 3D data is in microscopy often saved as a .tif, saving all voxels (volume pixels) values in order on the disk.

The blender volume data format is a [.vdb](https://www.openvdb.org/forum/), which is a tree-like data format, so the standard tif-grid data needs to first be restructured to be able to load into blender.
<details><summary>About the vdb data structure</summary>VDBs contain multiple scales of voxels, where the larger ones mostly contain whether there is data in its lower nodes. In this way, when a lightray traverses a large volume, it does not have to check every voxel for an intersection.

## Running tif loader

The `tif loader` Add-On creates a field in `Scene Properties`, asking you for a tif file and dimensionality. Pressing `load tif` calls some python functions that unpack your tif file, resave it as a .vdb and load this into your Blender scene.

There is an example tif stack we will use in the course [here](../data/RPE1_Expansion_MeOH_405DAPI_488alphabetaTubulin_594acetylatTubulin_647NHS_zstack_40x_8bit.tif.zip). This first needs to be unzipped.
- <details><summary>About the example data</summary> The example data is a human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE-1) cell line, stained for microtubules (channel 0) and DNA (DAPI) (channel 1). Pixel size is 0.207 Âµm in Z, and 0.170 in X/Y. To achieve better resolution, the cell was imaged with Ultrastructure Expansion Microscopy (U-ExM), where the sample is physically expanded through a chemical process, enabling nanoscale imaging with standard microscopes, while preserving ultrastructure. See also <a href="../data/materials_methods_RPE1.md">full materials and methods</a>. The data was contributed by Granita Lokaj. </details>


Notes on input data:
- Data should be a .tif
- Any vdb >2048 axis length will load into separate chunks of volumes. You may need to apply some of the settings to all of the separate subvolumes separately.  <details><summary> details</summary> This is a workaround for <a href="https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/issues/83942">a known issue</a> with the Eevee volume render pipeline, which has a max size. Thus, Cycles can actually handle bigger datasets, but this can be very inconvenient as blender will crash immediately when accidentally opening a non-cycles viewport. </details>
- Note the **axes_order** parameter, if this is not the correct length (for example, your image is zyxc and you put in zyx axes_order) this will give an error and give you the dimensionality of your image. 
- <details><summary>Advanced</summary> The vdb format is optimized for sparse volumes with big empty areas. This is changed by thresholding your data before vdb conversion but this is currently not supported in tif loader. However, full sparse volume support in Blender is also not enabled, and most of the gain will probably be in Cycles. </details>

Press `Load TIF` when all values have been set correctly. Loading data will take some time, and more for big datasets.

This should yield a big gray box of data. In here is your data, it is just not rendered yet! For this: go to the [rendering lesson 1a](./1a_eevee_emission.md) :yum:.
