# Blender_for_Biologists_2023

Hi! This is a course on blender, an open-source 3D modeling software, for biological visualization. This is created initially for the 2023 EMBL Predoc Course but will stay online afterwards, as resources on microscopy data visualization in blender seem sparse on the web. 

This workshop will hopefully show you:
- loading in 3D microscopy data render it in Blender
- emulating render modes of popular proprietary visualization software
- basic volume to mesh operations

With extra lessons:
- loading in multichannel data
- quick introduction for loading .pdb files with molecular nodes (better tutorials exist for this online)
- quick introduction to geometry nodes

This will not teach:
- Many blender basics you will not primarily need when using blender as a 3D data visualization tool (sculpting, modeling)
