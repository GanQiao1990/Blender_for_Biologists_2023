# Molecular Nodes

Rendering protein files inside blender has recently become a lot easier thanks to Brady Johnston's [Molecular Nodes](https://github.com/BradyAJohnston/MolecularNodes/releases/) package. 

I will not be going through how to set this up, as this is well-documented on the molecular nodes github pages, and on [youtube](https://youtu.be/CvmFaRVmZRU?si=ELG90XxtQZQUcWg3). However, because this is such a key element of blender as a biologist, I wanted to specifically refer to it in this tutorial :D.
